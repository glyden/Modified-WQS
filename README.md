# Penalized weighted sum regression for chemical mixtures
This repository contains the code to fit a modified form of Weighted Quantile Sum regression that allows for the entire dataset to be used in both weight estimation and inference, as introduced in "A permutation-based approach to inference for weighted sum regression with correlated chemical mixtures" by Lyden, et al.
